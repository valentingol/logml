LoggerML - Machine Learning Logger in the console
=================================================

Log your Machine Learning training in the console in a beautiful way
using `rich <https://github.com/Textualize/rich>`__\ ‚ú® with useful
information but with minimal code.

Installation
------------

In a new virtual environment, install simply the package via
`pipy <https://pypi.org/project/loggerml/>`__:

.. code:: bash

   pip install loggerml

Supported platforms
-------------------

This package assume that you are using a terminal that support ANSI
escape sequences. See
`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Platform_support>`__
for supported platforms. All Unix and Emacs distribution are supported
as well as Windows but only on some machine (Windows 11 seems to work
but not Windows 10).

The quick test to know if your terminal support ANSI escape sequence is
to run the following command in your terminal:

.. code:: script

   python -c "print('\x1B')"

It should print an *empty* line.

Quick start
-----------

Minimal usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integrate the LogML logger in your training loops! For instance for 4
epochs, 20 batches per epoch and a log interval of 2 batches:

.. code:: python

   from logml import Logger

   logger = Logger(
       n_epochs=4,
       n_batches=20,
       log_interval=2,
   )
   for _ in range(4):
       logger.start_epoch()  # Indicate the start of a new epoch
       for _ in range(20):
           logger.start_batch()  # Indicate the start of a new batch
           # Log every 2 batches but you should call the log method at every batch
           logger.log({'loss': 0.54321256, 'accuracy': 0.85244777})

Yields:

.. figure:: assets/base.gif
   :alt: Alt Text

   Alt Text

Advanced usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you can customize the logger with your own styles and colors. You
can set the default configuration at the initialization of the logger
and then you can override it during log. You can also log the averaged
value over the epoch. For instance:

.. code:: python

   logger = Logger(
       n_epochs=4,
       n_batches=20,
       styles='yellow',
       sizes={'accuracy': 2},
       average=['loss'],  # loss will be averaged over the current epoch
       bold_keys=True,
       show_time=False,  # Remove the time bar
   )
   for _ in range(4):
       logger.start_epoch()
       for _ in range(20):
           logger.start_batch()
           # Overwrite the default style for "loss" and add a message
           logger.log(
               {'loss': 0.54321256, 'accuracy': 85.244777},
               styles={'loss': 'italic red'},
               message="Training is going well?\nYes!",
           )

Yields:

.. figure:: assets/advanced.gif
   :alt: Alt Text

   Alt Text

Don‚Äôt know the number of batches in advance?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don‚Äôt have the number of batches in advance, you can initialize
the logger with ``n_batches=None``. Only the available information will
be displayed. For instance with the configuration of the first example:

.. figure:: assets/no_n_batches.png
   :alt: Alt Text

   Alt Text

The progress bar is replaced by a cyclic animation. The eta times are
not know at the first epoch but was estimated after the second epoch.

Todo
----

Priority:

-  ‚òê Doc with Sphinx
-  ‚òê Be compatible with Windows and notebooks (with curses and some
   tricks)

Secondary:

-  ‚òê Explain how to use a tracker log (wandb for instance) with LogML
-  ‚òê Use regex for ``styles``, ``sizes`` and ``average`` keys

Done:

-  ‚òí Manage a validation loop (then multiple loggers)
-  ‚òê [STRIKEOUT:Enable not using ``new_epoch/log()`` if log config is
   minimal]
-  ‚òí Add color customization for message, epoch/batch number and time

How to contribute
-----------------

For **development**, install the package dynamically and dev
requirements with:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -e .
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Everyone can contribute to LogML, and we value everyone‚Äôs contributions.
