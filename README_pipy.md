## Installation

In a new virtual environment, install simply the package via pipy:

```bash
pip install loggerml
```

**Be careful, Windows 10 is not supported (but Windows 11 yes).**

## Quick start

Integrate the LogML logger in your training loop. For instance for 4 epochs,
20 batches per epoch and a log interval of 2 batches:

```python
from logml import Logger

logger = Logger(
    n_epochs=4,
    n_batches=20,
    log_interval=2,
)
for _ in range(4):
    logger.start_epoch()  # Indicate the start of a new epoch
    for _ in range(20):
        logger.start_batch()  # Indicate the start of a new batch
        logger.log({'loss': 0.54321256, 'accuracy': 0.85244777})
```

Yields:

```script
Epoch 1/4, batch 20/20
[================================================][100%]
[global 00:00:02 > 00:00:06 | epoch 00:00:02 > 00:00:00]
loss: 0.5432 | accuracy: 0.8524 |

Epoch 2/4, batch 8/20
[=================>                              ][40%]
[global 00:00:03 > 00:00:05 | epoch 00:00:01 > 00:00:01]
loss: 0.5432 | accuracy: 0.8524 |
```

Now you can customize the logger with your own styles and colors. You can set the default configuration at the initialization of the logger and then you can override it during log. For instance:

```python
logger = Logger(
    n_epochs=4,
    n_batches=20,
    # (Log interval by default is 1, log every batch)
    styles='yellow',
    digits={'accuracy': 2},
    average=['loss'],  # loss will be averaged over the current epoch
    bold_keys=True,
    show_time=False,  # Remove the time bar
)
for _ in range(4):
    logger.start_epoch()
    for _ in range(20):
        logger.start_batch()
        # Overwrite the default style for "loss" and add a message
        logger.log(
            {'loss': 0.54321256, 'accuracy': 85.244777},
            styles={'loss': 'italic red'},
            message="Training is going well?\nYes!",
        )
```

Yields:

```script
Epoch 1/4, batch 20/20
[================================================][100%]
loss: 0.5432 | accuracy: 0.8524 |

Epoch 2/4, batch 7/20
[=================>                              ][35%]
[global 00:00:03 > 00:00:05 | epoch 00:00:01 > 00:00:01]
loss: 0.5432 | accuracy: 0.8524 |
Training is going well?
Yes!
```

With the following style and coloration:

<span style="color:red">***loss***: *0.5432*</span> | <span style="color:yellow">**accuracy**: 0.8524</span> |

Finally, if you don't have the number of batches in advance, you can initialize the logger with `n_batches=None`. Only the available information will be displayed. For instance with the configuration of the first example:

```script
Epoch 1/4, batch 20/20
[  *                                             ][ ? %]
[global 00:00:02 >  ? | epoch 00:00:02 >  ? ]
loss: 0.5432 | accuracy: 0.8524 |

Epoch 2/4, batch 8/20
[                           *                     ][ ? %]
[global 00:00:03 > 00:00:05 | epoch 00:00:01 > 00:00:01]
loss: 0.5432 | accuracy: 0.8524 |
```

The progress bar is replaced by a cyclic animation. The eta times are not know at the first epoch but was estimated after the second epoch.

## Todo

- [ ] Manage a validation loop (then multiple loggers)
- [ ] Enable not using `new_epoch/log()` if log config is minimal
- [ ] Add color customization for message, epoch/batch number and time

## How to contribute

For **development**, install the package dynamically and dev requirements with:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
